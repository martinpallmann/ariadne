# Ariadne Tracing

You should probablye use https://github.com/zio/zio-telemetry instead which does the same but better.

This is a ~~shameless rip-off~~ friendly fork
of [natchez](https://github.com/tpolecat/natchez) by [Rob Norris](https://github.com/tpolecat).

Just for zio instead of cats.

It's a work in progress. Almost nothing works yet.
